            <h3>FACTS</h3> 
            <h4><b>Pluto is one third water</b></h4>
            <p>This is in the form of water ice which is more than 3 times as much water as in all the
                Earth’s oceans, the remaining two thirds are rock. Pluto’s surface is covered with ices, and
                has several mountain ranges, light and dark regions, and a scattering of craters.</p>
                <h4>Pluto has been visited by one spacecraft</h4>
                <p>The New Horizons spacecraft, which was launched in 2006, flew by Pluto on the 14th of July
                    2015 and took a series of images and other measurements. New Horizons is now on its way
                    to the Kuiper Belt to explore even more distant objects.</p>
                    <h4><b>Pluto is the largest dwarf planet</b></h4>
                    <p>At one point it was thought this could be Eris. Currently the most accurate measurements
                        give Eris an average diameter of 2,326 km with a margin of error of 12 km, while Pluto’s
                        diameter is 2,372 km with a 2 km margin of error.</p>
