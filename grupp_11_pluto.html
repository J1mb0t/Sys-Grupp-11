      <h2>Facts</h2>
      <h4>Pluto is one third water</h4>
      <p align="left">
      This is in the form of water ice which is more than 3 times as<br>
      much water as in all the Earth’s oceans, the remaining two<br>
      thirds are rock. Pluto’s surface is covered with ices, and has<br>
      several mountain ranges, light and dark regions, and a<br>
      scattering of craters.<br>
      </p>

      <h4>Pluto has been visited by one spacecraft</h4>
      <p align="left">

      The New Horizons spacecraft, which was launched in 2006,<br>
      flew by Pluto on the 14th of July 2015 and took a series of<br>
      images and other measurements. New Horizons is now on its <br>
      way to the Kuiper Belt to explore even more distant objects.<br>
      </p> 
      <h4> Pluto is the largest dwarf planet</h4>
      <p align="left">
      At one point it was thought this could be Eris. Currently the most<br>
      accurate measurements give Eris an average diameter of 2,326<br>
      km with a margin of error of 12 km. while Pluto’s diameter is<br>
      2,372 km with a 2 km margin of error.<br>
  
    </p>
    <p align="right">
      Diameter: 2372 <br>
      Orbit Period: 248 years<br>
      Surface Temperature: -229c<br>
